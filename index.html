                Election Returns is a scraping application that reads the current results of the 2012 Presidential
                election from the NYTimes.com website. In addition, there is a d3 visualization component that
                visualizes the returns that have been scraped.

                <b>Description:</b>
                The <a href="http://hubwaydatachallenge.org/">Hubway Visualization Challenge</a> was a contest run in 
                Boston during the Fall of 2012 to visualize 500,000+ bike trips on the Hubway system. My entry into the
                contest was twofold:
                <ul>
                    <li><i><a href="http://d3js.org/">d3</a> visualizations</i>: Using d3, I had a web app look at cross sections of the rider
                        populations in three different ways. Each of the visualization cross sections linked to
                        the other sections, so you could traverse the visualization modes seamlessly.
                    </li>
                    <li><i><a href="http://graphserver.github.com/graphserver/">graphserver</a> visualizations</i>: Using graphserver, I used the routing engine in graphserver
                        to composite trips for segments of time together, and visualize where people were traveling,
                        based on their starting point and ending point. This final result was compiled into a movie.
                        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4JH7auuuHc">The final compilation is on youtube.</a>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <b>Description:</b>
                SpamLibs takes spam email messages, and uses them for Mad Libs&trade;.
                The application runs the body of the spam email through a natural language processor
                to determine the types of words in the message (noun, adjective, verb). The application then
                randomly removes many of the original words, and prompts users to fill in the missing types
                of speech.  After a user has submitted the form, the application takes the user submitted 
                vocabulary and combines it with the original spam email, often to hilarious effect!

                <b>Description:</b>
                vTour is a method of searching for geotagged photographs on 3 major photo sharing APIs:
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="http://www.flickr.com/">Flickr</a></li>
                    <li><a href="http://www.panoramio.com/">Panoramio</a></li>
                    <li><a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/explore">Picasa</a></li>
                </ul>
                A user can search by photos by selecting a place on the map, which brings up all photos that are
                geolocated within a certain distance of that place. The app performs a bounding-box search, since
                not all APIs support radius searching.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This app uses the python app <a href="http://featureserver.org/">FeatureServer</a> to save search results, which in turn saves features
                into a <a href="http://postgis.org/">PostGIS</a> database.
