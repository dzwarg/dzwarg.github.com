                        Aligner is a Python & PyGTK app that displays a directory full of images, and provides
                        simple controls for shifting images one by one.

                        <h4>Description</h4>
                        
                        <p>
                            Aligner was born out of the need to automatically align a large sequence of images that
                            were nearly aligned, but demonstrated poor coherence when compiled into a timelapse sequence.
                            The original image sequence that Aligner tackled was a time lapse series of webcam photographs
                            taken during the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq7YDdfziqQ">construction 
                            of the Comcast Tower in Center City Philadelphia.</a>
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                            The webcam photos were taken at one hour intervals over the course of about a year. During this
                            time, the webcam was shifted, rotated, wiggled, flexed, and bumped. In order to make the image
                            sequence somewhat viewable, the images needed to be shifted, or wrapped, to fix the position
                            of the building across all frames in the compiled film.                        
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                            An automated method was used to autocorrelate the images with each other, and that was only
                            moderately successful, because the images changed immensely over the course of a day, depending
                            on the weather, the illumination, which angle the camera was positioned, etc. Therefore, a
                            finer tool was needed to hone the sequence into position.

                        Bounce is a Python application written with pygame for the <a href="http://wiki.openmoko.org/wiki/Main_Page">
                        OpenMoko open source phone</a>. It uses the built-in accelerometers in the phone to move the image of a ball
                        around the screen.
                    </p>

                        <p>
                            Bounce was my first experiment with the pygame library for graphics & sounds, accelerometers, and touch
                            interfaces. Originally intended to be a 3D accelerometer game where the user tries to bounce a ball
                            inside a box, I was unable to reduce the latency of even 2D bouncing graphics + sound effects.

                            The better game is <a href="http://mokomaze.sourceforge.net/">MokoMaze</a> on the OpenMoko, anyway.

                            Everybody hates the experience of walking up to a coffee pot, not knowing if the pot is full or not,
                            and discovering that your worst fear is realized, and that the pot is indeed empty.  These experiences
                            were becoming common around the office, so I thought that I would apply a hardware solution to the 
                            caffeine problem.

                            The software in this repository is an arduino sketch that was running on an arduino + ethernet shield.
                            The sketch continuously measured the pressure on two different piezo sensors, and calculated the
                            full/empty ratio based on this measurement. On regular intervals, the sketch would publish the 
                            state of the coffee maker on pachube.com

                <b>Description:</b>
                The <a href="http://hubwaydatachallenge.org/">Hubway Visualization Challenge</a> was a contest run in 
                Boston during the Fall of 2012 to visualize 500,000+ bike trips on the Hubway system. My entry into the
                contest was twofold:
                <ul>
                    <li><i><a href="http://d3js.org/">d3</a> visualizations</i>: Using d3, I had a web app look at cross sections of the rider
                        populations in three different ways. Each of the visualization cross sections linked to
                        the other sections, so you could traverse the visualization modes seamlessly.
                    </li>
                    <li><i><a href="http://graphserver.github.com/graphserver/">graphserver</a> visualizations</i>: Using graphserver, I used the routing engine in graphserver
                        to composite trips for segments of time together, and visualize where people were traveling,
                        based on their starting point and ending point. This final result was compiled into a movie.
                        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4JH7auuuHc">The final compilation is on youtube.</a>

                SpamLibs takes spam email messages, and uses them for Mad Libs&trade;.
                The application runs the body of the spam email through a natural language processor
                to determine the types of words in the message (noun, adjective, verb). The application then
                randomly removes many of the original words, and prompts users to fill in the missing types
                of speech.  After a user has submitted the form, the application takes the user submitted 
                vocabulary and combines it with the original spam email, often to hilarious effect!

                <b>Description:</b>
                vTour is a method of searching for geotagged photographs on 3 major photo sharing APIs:
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="http://www.flickr.com/">Flickr</a></li>
                    <li><a href="http://www.panoramio.com/">Panoramio</a></li>

                </ul>
                A user can search by photos by selecting a place on the map, which brings up all photos that are
                geolocated within a certain distance of that place. The app performs a bounding-box search, since
                not all APIs support radius searching.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This app uses the python app <a href="http://featureserver.org/">FeatureServer</a> to save search results, which in turn saves features
                into a <a href="http://postgis.org/">PostGIS</a> database.
